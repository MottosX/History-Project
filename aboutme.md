# About Spencer Nguyen's Digital History Project

## Student Information
- **Name**: Spencer Nguyen  
- **Class**: HIST110 - Digital History Methods
- **Instructor**: Professor Pastrana
- **Semester**: Summer 2025
- **Project Title**: "Evolution of American Firearms: Revolutionary War to Civil War"

## Project Overview
This digital history project examines the technical development of American firearms from 1776 to 1865, exploring how weapon technology evolved and transformed military strategy across four major conflicts. Through careful analysis of primary sources and multimedia presentations, this project demonstrates how innovations in accuracy, reload speed, and reliability enabled American military victories despite often being outnumbered or undersupplied.

## Historical Scope & Research Questions
**Time Period**: Revolutionary War through Civil War (1776-1865)

**Key Research Questions:**
1. How did technical improvements in firearms technology progress from flintlock muskets to repeating rifles?
2. What role did innovations like percussion caps and rifling play in changing battlefield tactics?
3. How did superior American weapons technology compensate for limitations in troop numbers during conflicts?
4. What primary evidence exists of these technological impacts on military outcomes?
